This demo is using the TR-UTV algorithm for seismic data denoising.

It currently supports testing on three datasets: the synthetic dataset, the Penobscot-3D dataset, and the Kerry-3D dataset.

For the synthetic datset, run the function "TR_UTV_Denoising_Synthetic.m" from the "TR-UTV_Denoising_Synthetic" folder. Similarly, for the field dataset, run the function "TR_UTV_Denoising_Field.m" from the "TR-UTV_Denoising_Field" folder.

If you are testing a different dataset and cannot obtain effective denoising results, please adjust the parameter settings in the function "Paraset_TR-UTV.m".
